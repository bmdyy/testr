# Solution

## Auth Bypass : XSS

`/api` is vulnerable to XSS in the q parameter. There is a filter to protect against XSS, but it is possible to get around it.

We know that the admin checks all links when you apply for a membership, and so we can craft a malicious link to send requests on his behalf. Specifically, we want to change his secret phrase, and then his password.

PoC: `xss.py`

## RCE : (Python) Code Injection

`/editor` lets us run python code on the server. There is a filter in place to attempt to protect the server from running malicious code, but it is possible to bypass this.

PoC: `code_inj.py`
